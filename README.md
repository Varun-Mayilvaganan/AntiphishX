### AntiphishX
A robust phishing detection framework that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including adversarial training and multi-modal feature extraction. By analyzing diverse data sources such as URLs, HTML content, metadata, and user behavior, AntiPhishX uses GAN generated samples to avoid adversarial attacks.
## Key Features

1. **Adversarial Training**:  
   - Integrates adversarial phishing websites generated by **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** into the training data, enhancing model robustness against phishing attacks crafted to deceive standard detection models.

2. **Multi-modal Feature Extraction**:  
   - **URL-based features**: Analyzes URL structure, length, and the presence of suspicious keywords.
   - **HTML content analysis**: Extracts phishing-related signatures from the webpage’s structure and content.
   - **Metadata analysis**: Leverages metadata such as **expiration date**,**DNS record** and **WHOIS data** for further phishing site identification.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - Performance is measured through key metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **adversarial robustness**, ensuring comprehensive evaluation of the model’s phishing detection capabilities.

4. **Interactive Notebooks**:  
   - Use **Google colab** or **Jupyter notebooks** to facilitate running experiments, tuning models, and visualizing results, making it easy for us to explore and modify the code.
